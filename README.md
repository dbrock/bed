# bed, a simple tool for writing

Writing can be fun. It can also be tedious. Sometimes it feels like
the text you're writing is a blob of amorphous stupidity. There are
some tools that try to make writing more fun, simple, direct. This is
another one. It makes you edit one line at a time. Or one paragraph at
a time.

It's inspired by chat. I noticed that when I'm chatting, there's a
rhythm and liveliness that I miss when I face a text document. As far
as I can tell, it's because chat has natural "units" or "chunks,"
namely lines. You write a line and hit `Enter`. Then you write another
one.

Let's say `bed` stands for `better ed`. Of course, `ed` is the
standard text editor on Unix systems. It's simple to the point of
absurdity. Since it was invented decades ago, it forces you to write
and edit line-by-line. Ever since its successor, `vi`, we've been
using "visual" editors. But `ed` has its charms.

## Technology

`bed` uses PouchDB.
